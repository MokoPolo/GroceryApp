good todo sample
https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react

in container click add
fire onclick
bubbles up. app adds to grocery list
then gets grocery list and feeds to grocery list props and reloads component


I'd want to click add recipe to grocery list and update grocery list
a few changes:
1) will receive a recipe list in props and load. no api calls
2) will receive a grocerylist. no api calls
