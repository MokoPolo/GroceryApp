# GroceryApp



TODO
1) Display single recipe (and items) -- done
2) Display grocery list -- done
3) Show all recipes in a list -- done
4) All the components done already access real data -- done
    - might have to install state management - not yet
5) Show grocery list with all grocery items -- done
6) Add more recipes. Then have button to add recipe from recipe list to grocery list
7) Select recipes from list and ingredients to grocery list
    - this feature will receive recipe id from client. then it will do a query to fetch ingredients. then i will insert ingredients to grocery list. maybe get 
    ingredients from grocery list and do distinct or something

8) style in bootstrap

in container click add
fire onclick
bubbles up. app adds to grocery list
then gets grocery list and feeds to grocery list props and reloads component


I'd want to click add recipe to grocery list and update grocery list
a few changes:
1) will receive a recipe list in props and load. no api calls
2) will receive a grocerylist. no api calls

Add remove grocery items
Add remove recipe names
Add remove grocery items
